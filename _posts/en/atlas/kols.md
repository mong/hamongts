# Fact sheets for different patient samples in the COPD Healthcare Atlas

The fact sheets provide a brief description of the patient samples, as well as information about the population’s use of services in geographical areas (hospital referral areas). The use is measured as the number of events per 10,000 population or as the proportion of patients that receive a certain service. The fact sheets also include brief comments on the variation in use between geographical areas.
