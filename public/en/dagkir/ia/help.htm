        <div id="ia-help-legend" class="ia-help-section-header">Legend</div>
        <div class="ia-help-section">
            <p><em>Selecting and Highlighting:</em> Click a class to select the geographic features that fall within that class. Hold your mouse pointer over a feature in the map, table or charts to highlight the legend class which the geographic feature falls in.</p>
            <p><em>Legend Settings:</em> The legend can be controlled by clicking on the 'cogwheel' icon that appears in the top right hand corner of the component when you hover over the legend. This will open the Legend Settings dialogue box. The items available in the legend settings depend on the type of indicator (numeric or categoric), the geography type of the base geography layer (polygons, lines or points) and the selected legend classification.</p>
            <p><em>Palette:</em> You can change the colour palette used to shade geographic features in the map by clicking on a new palette.</p>
            <p><em>Reverse Palette:</em> For numeric indicators the legend settings include a button with two arrows, one pointing up and one pointing down. By clicking this button box you can reverse the colour palette used to shade geographic features in the map.</p>
            <p><em>No. Classes:</em> For numeric indicators the legend settings include a '+' and a '-' button. By clicking these you can increase or decrease the number of classes. The administrator may have fixed the maximum number of classes. If the legend classification is either 'Continuous' or 'Standard Deviation', these buttons will not be available.</p>
            <p><em>Min Point Size / Min Line Width:</em> If the data in your dynamic report is being displayed as proportional points or lines, the legend settings will include '+' and '-' buttons to change the minimum point size or the minimum line width.</p>
            <p><em>Max Point Size / Max Line Width:</em> If the data in your dynamic report is being displayed as proportional points or lines, the legend settings will include '+' and '-' buttons to change the maximum point size or the maximum line width.</p>
            <p><em>Classifiers:</em> For numeric indicators the legend settings include an option to select different classifiers. The selected classification method will decide how the ranges are calculated.</p>
            <p><em>Equal Interval:</em> The intervals between class breaks are equal. Class breaks are calculated on-the-fly and will update if you change the number of classes. Geographic features in the same class are given the same shade. The administrator may have configured the report so that the class breaks are the same across all indicators in the report. The advantage of the equal-interval classification is that many map users will find it simple to understand. However, a disadvantage is that only the minimum and maximum data values are used when determining class breaks for the intervals (rather than the way the data is spread).</p>
            <p><em>Quantile:</em> Each class in the legend contains an approximately equal number of geographic features. Class breaks are calculated on-the-fly and will update if you change the number of classes. Geographic features in the same class are given the same shade. Two advantages of the quantile classification are that it is appropriate for ordinal data (as data are rank-ordered) and that it can help make map comparisons (assuming that the same number of classifications is used for all maps). A disadvantage of the quantile classification is that it does not consider how the data are distributed. If the data distribution is highly skewed, data observations will be forced into the same class (either the lowest or highest) where this may not be appropriate. As a result, the quantile classification may give a false impression that there is a relatively normal data distribution.</p>
            <p><em>Natural Breaks:</em> This classification method is also known as Optimal Breaks and Jenks Method. Class breaks are calculated on-the-fly and will update if you change the number of classes. Data are assigned to classes based upon their position along the data distribution relative to all other data values. An iterative algorithm is used to assign values to classes such that the variances within all classes are minimised whereas the variances among classes are maximised. The advantage of this classification is that the data distribution is explicitly considered for determining class breaks. However, the disadvantage is that map users may not understand the classification method used and that class breaks may not be immediately intuitive. </p>
            <p><em>Continuous:</em> Each geographic feature is shaded a different shade using a continuous scale. This legend type is useful for identifying extremely high or low values. Where an indicator has only a small number of unique data values (say 5 or less) this may be the most appropriate legend type to apply.</p>
            <p><em>Standard Deviation:</em> Class breaks reflect the number of standard deviations from the data average (or mean). Geographic features are classified according to how many standard deviations above or below the average their indicator value falls. Geographic features in the same class are given the same shade. You cannot change the number of classes for this legend type.</p>

Contextual geographies and background images may have been included by the administrator and can also be toggled on or off using the check boxes in the map layers box. Background images are "scale dependent" - they may turn on or off as you zoom into or out of the map. Note that images may not be visible at full map extent and you may need to zoom to a smaller area for them to appear. Depending on how the report has been configured, it may take some time for background images to appear.</p>

		<div id="ia-help-pyramidchart" class="ia-help-section-header">Pyramid Chart</div>
		<div class="ia-help-section">
			<p>The pyramid chart displays indicator data belonging to one selected map feature in a back to back horizontal bar chart. This chart is typically used to show population structure broken down by age groups and gender. Simply select a geographic feature in the map, data table or bar chart to fill the pyramid chart with data for the selected feature. The bars on the right side of the chart will display the numeric indicator values of the first theme (usually males) whereas the bars on the left will display the numeric indicator values of the second theme (usually females) for the selected feature. Data for comparison areas will be displayed as smooth lines on top of the bars of the selected map feature. The chart may be configured to show further lines e.g. predicted values.</p>

        <div id="ia-help-scatterplot" class="ia-help-section-header">Scatter Plot</div>
        <div class="ia-help-section">
            <p>The scatter plot displays the relationship between data for two different indicators or time periods. Read the axis labels to see which data are being plotted. Hold your mouse pointer over a dot in the scatter plot to display a tooltip with the name and values of the geographic feature it relates to. The administrator may have configured the report to display a correlation coefficient, line of best fit and an equation for this line. The correlation coefficient is Pearson's Product Moment Coefficient.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="ia-help-bubbleplot" class="ia-help-section-header">Bubble Plot</div>
        <div class="ia-help-section">
            <p>The bubble plot is a scatterplot in which the size and colour of the points can vary. Up to four indicators can therefore be represented simultaneously (x-axis value, y-axis value, size and colour). The indicator that defines bubble colour is that which is shown in the other components of the report. It may be possible to select the indicators shown in the bubble plot independently or the administrator may have pre-defined them. Hold your mouse pointer over a bubble to display a tooltip with the name and values of the geographic feature it relates to.</p>

        <div class="ia-help-section">
            <p>The funnel plot is a scatterplot upon which confidence limits have been superimposed. It is useful when observations for different areas are based on varying sample/population sizes. The funnel shaped confidence limits indicate that as sample/population sizes decrease, an observation must be further from the regional/national average to be statistically significantly different. Hold your mouse pointer over a point to display a tooltip with the name and value of the geographic feature it corresponds to</p>

        <div id="ia-help-spinechart" class="ia-help-section-header">Spine Chart</div>
        <div class="ia-help-section">
            <p>The spine chart displays cross-indicator information (i.e. a profile) for any selected area(s). It may do this using text, symbols and proportional bars. A legend explaining the symbols used is shown in the Profile Key. Select a geographic feature in the map, data table or bar chart to make it appear in the spine chart. The proportional bars will show in a different colour for each different geographic feature. The geographic feature name(s) together with their bar colour will be displayed in the selected features legend.</p>

			<p>The proportional bars usually represent either the indicator values themselves or a percentage difference between the indicator value and a regional/national comparator. Target values may be superimposed as vertical bars. For each indicator, minimum/maximum values may be shown at either side of each bar. The bars themselves may be superimposed on coloured ranges that show how an area is performing. You can scroll the chart to see indicators that are listed further up or down. By clicking on a row in the spine chart you may be able to change the indicator being shown in the map, bar chart and pie chart. Close to the spine chart you may find the '-/+' button. This will collapse and expand the themes in the chart.</p>
